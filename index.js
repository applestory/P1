It was an absolute lifeline for me as an international student, providing (increasingly rare) affordable housing near the city wherein i could not just concentrate on my studies but also form new friendships. A home away from home, that was crucial for my wellbeing. The residence provides both individual private space and clean, communal spaces. The staff (Grace and Mirek) plus the manager (Adam) are absolute gems - ever so prompt, accomodative and helpful. Will remain grateful to them throughout my life.",

Its close proximity to Waite and universities/colleges in the CBD makes it one of the preferred residences. The rent is affordable and basic services a generously provided. Adam the manager is likeable and professional. I always refer international students to Gosse. Adam, keep the fire burning as I plan to visit soon!",
